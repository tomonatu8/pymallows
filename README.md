```

## Usage

```python
from mallows import generate_mallows_votes

# Generate 10 votes with 5 candidates
num_candidates = 5
num_voters = 10
phi = 0.5  # dispersion parameter (0 = identical votes, 1 = random votes)
reference_ranking = list(range(num_candidates))  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# Generate votes
votes = generate_mallows_votes(num_candidates, num_voters, phi, reference_ranking)

# Print the votes
for i, vote in enumerate(votes):
    print(f"Voter {i+1}: {vote}")
